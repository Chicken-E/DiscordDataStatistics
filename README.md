# DiscordDataStatistics
Right now only message statistics from requested discord data. In future, maybe more.

Run with node on the root folder of your discord data. (You need to install csv-parser with npm first)

Makes 2 files, "messages.csv" and "attachements.txt".

Doesn't send your data across the internet anywhere, source is commented and easy to understand.
